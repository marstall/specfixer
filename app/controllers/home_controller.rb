```ruby
class HomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @quote_of_the_day = Quote.first
  end
end
```

The fix removes the explanatory text that was accidentally included at the end of the file and keeps only the valid Ruby code. The controller now properly assigns `Quote.first` to the instance variable, which should satisfy the test expectations.
